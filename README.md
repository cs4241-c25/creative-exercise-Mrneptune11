### I decided to do the SVG assignment

The examples I used to write my code come from the 
following svg tutorial:

https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp

I started out keeping it as html, but then converted
it to be drawn on a canvas with Javascript. I also
changed values like color, opacity, stroke, fill, 
and used a gradient

In order to animate and change shape parameters I 
used React's useEffect and useState.
